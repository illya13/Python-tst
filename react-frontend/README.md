# React Frontend

Modern React frontend built with Vite that consumes the Python backend API.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will run on `http://localhost:5173` by default.

## Configuration

The frontend connects to the Node.js backend at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

You can override this by creating a `.env` file:
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Note:** The Node.js backend then calls the Python backend, creating the flow: React → Node.js → Python
